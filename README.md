# So, What is Paradise Tours?

Mobile application for medium-sized tours companies to help them automate the process of hotel reservation and reduce the amount of phone calls between executives and employess 

# The Problem

The problem that most of these companies faces - exept the ones that are using any type of software already - is that when a client calls for a reservation , the employee has no way to know whether there are available rooms , so the employee will call the manager or executive to ask him then call the client back !
and that is a tedious process and takes a lot of time , a simple mobile app can solve this problem.
